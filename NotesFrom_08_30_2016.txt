Notes for 30/08/16 - updated 4/9/16
GUI:
	- Required Feature:
		- Graphic Window (work out minimum size later)
		- Plotting area to display output regrssion line
		- Config menu to alter how the algorithm produces the result

	- Optional Feature:
		- Scaling of the graph
		- Real Time fitness Evolution graph
		- Changing prediction data

Genetic Algorithm and Programming
	- Required 
		- Prediction Windows (Decade, Year, Month, Week, Day)
		- Prdeiction time frame (Predict a year, month, week, day)

	- Optional
		- Real time window changes

Genetic Programming:
	- A simple change from the genetic algorithm (Research recorded in links file)

	Gene structure:
		- Possibly a tree representation (Done)
		- Genetic programming for trees Wikipedia (Done)
		- More research required, how to structure genes, how to equate genes (Gene structure is good, may need to implement parser)

Crossovers:
	- Uniform
	- One Point
	- Two Point
	- Three Parent
	- MORE RESEARCH REQUIRED

Mutations:
	- Uniform
	- Reverse Sequence
	- Twors
	- MORE RESEARCH REQUIRED

Termination Point :
	- Fitness based
	- Generation number
	- Time based
	- Combination 
	- MORE RESEARCH REQUIRED

Tasks:
	- Research crossovers and mutations - Sean
	- Research genetic programming - Katie
	- Learn Genetic Sharp - Adrian
