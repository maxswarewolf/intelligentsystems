Notes for 30/08/16
Gene structure:
	- Possibly a tree representation (Done)
	- Genetic programming for trees Wikipedia (Done)
	- More research required, how to structure genes, how to equate genes (Gene structure is good, may need to implement parser)

Crossovers and mutations:
 	- Must decide on which ones to use, which ones are preferred, and which ones would be more efficient/effective for our problem
	- More research required

GUI:
	- 

Genetic Programming:
	- A simple change from the genetic algorithm (Research recorded in links file)

Tasks:
	- Research crossovers and mutations - Sean
	- Research genetic programming - Katie
